The **icanboogie/http** package provides an API to handle HTTP requests, with representations for
requests, request files, responses, and headers. A request dispatcher is also provided, that can be
used with your favorite routing solution with very little effort.

The following example demonstrates how you can use a simple closure to create a _Hello world!_
application:

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request;
use ICanBoogie\HTTP\RequestDispatcher;
use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Response;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$dispatcher = new RequestDispatcher([

    'hello world' => function(Request $request) {

        $who = $request['name'] ?: 'world';

        return new Response("Hello $who!", Response::STATUS_OK, [

            'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'

        ]);

    }

]);

$request = Request::from($_SERVER);
$response = $dispatcher($request);
$response();
```

> **Note:** You might want to check the [icanboogie/routing][] package if you require a nice router.





#### Installation

```bash
composer require icanboogie/http
```





## Request

A request is represented by a [Request][] instance. The initial request is usually created from
the `$_SERVER` array, while sub requests are created from arrays of `Request::OPTION_*` or
`RequestOptions::OPTION_*` options.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request;

$initial_request = Request::from($_SERVER);

# a custom request in the same environment

$request = Request::from('path/to/file.html', $_SERVER);

# a request created from scratch

$request = Request::from([

    Request::OPTION_PATH => 'path/to/file.html',
    Request::OPTION_IS_LOCAL => true,            // or OPTION_IP => '::1'
    Request::OPTION_IS_POST => true,             // or OPTION_METHOD => Request::METHOD_POST
    Request::OPTION_HEADERS => [

        'Cache-Control' => 'no-cache'

    ]

]);
```





### Safe and idempotent requests

Safe methods are HTTP methods that do not modify resources. For instance, using `GET` or `HEAD` on a
resource URL, should NEVER change the resource.

The `is_safe` property may be used to check if a request is safe or not.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request;

Request::from([ Request::OPTION_METHOD => Request::METHOD_GET ])->is_safe; // true
Request::from([ Request::OPTION_METHOD => Request::METHOD_POST ])->is_safe; // false
Request::from([ Request::OPTION_METHOD => Request::METHOD_DELETE ])->is_safe; // false
```

An idempotent HTTP method is a HTTP method that can be called many times without different outcomes.
It would not matter if the method is called only once, or ten times over. The result should be the
same.

The `is_idempotent` property may be used to check if a request is idempotent or not.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request;

Request::from([ Request::OPTION_METHOD => Request::METHOD_GET ])->is_idempotent; // true
Request::from([ Request::OPTION_METHOD => Request::METHOD_POST ])->is_idempotent; // false
Request::from([ Request::OPTION_METHOD => Request::METHOD_DELETE ])->is_idempotent; // true
```





### A request with changed properties

Requests are for the most part immutable, the `with()` method creates an instance copy with
changed properties.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request;

$request = Request::from($_SERVER)->with([

    Request::OPTION_IS_HEAD => true,
    Request::OPTION_IS_XHR => true

]);
```




### Request parameters

Whether they are sent as part of the query string, the post body, or the path info, parameters
sent along a request are collected in arrays. The `query_params`, `request_params`,
and `path_params` properties give you access to these parameters.

You can access each type of parameter as follows:

```php
<?php

/* @var $request \ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request */

$id = $request->query_params['id'];
$method = $request->request_params['method'];
$info = $request->path_params['info'];
```

All the request parameters are also available through the `params` property, which merges the
_query_, _request_ and _path_ parameters:

```php
<?php

/* @var $request \ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request */

$id = $request->params['id'];
$method = $request->params['method'];
$info = $request->params['info'];
```

Used as an array, the [Request][] instance provides these parameters as well, but returns `null`
when a parameter is not defined:

```php
<?php

/* @var $request \ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request */

$id = $request['id'];
$method = $request['method'];
$info = $request['info'];

var_dump($request['undefined']); // null
```

Of course, the request is also an iterator:

```php
<?php

/* @var $request \ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request */

foreach ($request as $parameter => $value)
{
    echo "$parameter: $value\n";
}
```





### Request files

Files associated with a request are collected in a [FileList][] instance. The initial request
created with `$_SERVER` obtain its files from `$_FILES`. For custom requests, files are defined
using `OPTION_FILES`.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\FileOptions as File;
use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request;

$request = Request::from($_SERVER);

# or

$request = Request::from([

    Request::OPTION_FILES => [

        'uploaded' => [ File::OPTION_PATHNAME => '/path/to/my/example.zip' ]

    ]

]);

#

$files = $request->files;    // instanceof FileList
$file = $files['uploaded'];  // instanceof File
$file = $files['undefined']; // null
```

Uploaded files, and _pretend_ uploaded files, are represented by [File][] instances. The class
tries its best to provide the same API for both. The `is_uploaded` property helps you set
them apart.

The `is_valid` property is a simple way to check if a file is valid. The `move()` method
let's you move the file out of the temporary folder or around the filesystem.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\File;

/* @var $file File */

echo $file->name;            // example.zip
echo $file->unsuffixed_name; // example
echo $file->extension;       // .zip
echo $file->size;            // 1234
echo $file->type;            // application/zip
echo $file->is_uploaded;     // false

if ($file->is_valid)
{
    $file->move('/path/to/repository/' . $file->name, File::MOVE_OVERWRITE);
}
```

The `match()` method is used to check if a file matches a MIME type, a MIME class, or a file
extension:

```php
<?php

/* @var $file \ICanBoogie\HTTP\File */

echo $file->match('application/zip');             // true
echo $file->match('application');                 // true
echo $file->match('.zip');                        // true
echo $file->match('image/png');                   // false
echo $file->match('image');                       // false
echo $file->match('.png');                        // false
```

The method also handles sets, and returns `true` if there's any match:

```php
echo $file->match([ '.png', 'application/zip' ]); // true
echo $file->match([ '.png', '.zip' ]);            // true
echo $file->match([ 'image/png', '.zip' ]);       // true
echo $file->match([ 'image/png', 'text/plain' ]); // false
```

[File][] instances implement the [ToArray][] interface and can be converted into arrays
with the `to_array()` method:

```php
$file->to_array();
/*
[
    'name' => 'example.zip',
    'unsuffixed_name' => 'example',
    'extension' => '.zip',
    'type' => 'application/zip',
    'size' => 1234,
    'pathname' => '/path/to/my/example.zip',
    'error' => null,
    'error_message' => null
]
*/
```





### Request context

Because requests may be nested the request context offers a safe place where you can store the state
of your application that is relative to a request, for instance a request relative site, page,
route, dispatcherâ€¦ The context may be used as an array, but is also a prototyped instance.

The following example demonstrates how to store a value in a request context:

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request;

$request = Request::from($_SERVER);
$request->context['site'] = $app->models['sites']->one;
```

The following example demonstrates how to use the prototype feature to provide a value when it is
requested from the context:

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request;
use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request\Context;
use ICanBoogie\Prototype;

Prototype::from(Context::class)['lazy_get_site'] = function(Context $context) use ($site_model) {

    return $site_model->resolve_from_request($context->request);

};

$request = Request::from($_SERVER);

$site = $request->context['site'];
# or
$site = $request->context->site;
```





### Obtaining a response

A response is obtained from a request simply by invoking the request, or by invoking one of the
available HTTP methods. The `dispatch()` helper is used to dispatch the request. A [Response][]
instance is returned if the dispatching is successful, a [NotFound][] exception is
thrown otherwise.

```php
<?php

/* @var $request \ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request */

$response = $request();

# using the POST method and additional parameters

$response = $request->post([ 'param' => 'value' ]);
```





## Response

The response to a request is represented by a [Response][] instance. The response body can
either be `null`, a string, an object implementing `__toString()`, or a closure.

> **Note:** Contrary to [Request][] instances, [Response][] instances or completely mutable.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Response;

$response = new Response('<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h1>Hello world!</h1></body></html>', Response::STATUS_OK, [

    'Content-Type' => 'text/html',
    'Cache-Control' => 'public, max-age=3600'

]);

```

The header and body are sent by invoking the response:

```php
<?php

/* @var $response \ICanBoogie\HTTP\Response */

$response();
```





### Response status

The response status is represented by a [Status][] instance. It may be defined as a HTTP response
code such as `200`, an array such as `[ 200, "Ok" ]`, or a string such as `"200 Ok"`.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Response;
use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Status;

$response = new Response;

echo $response->status;               // 200 Ok
echo $response->status->code;         // 200
echo $response->status->message;      // Ok
$response->status->is_valid;          // true

$response->status = Response::STATUS_NOT_FOUND;
echo $response->status->code;         // 404
echo $response->status->message;      // Not Found
$response->status->is_valid;          // false
$response->status->is_client_error;   // true
$response->status->is_not_found;      // true
```





### Streaming the response body

When a large response body needs to be streamed, it is recommended to use a closure as response
body instead of a huge string that would consume a lot of memory.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Response;
use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Status;

$records = $app->models->order('created_at DESC');

$output = function() use ($records) {

    $out = fopen('php://output', 'w');

    foreach ($records as $record)
    {
        fputcsv($out, [ $record->title, $record->created_at ]);
    }

    fclose($out);

};

$response = new Response($output, Response::STATUS_OK, [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/csv' ]);
```





### About the `Content-Length` header field

Before v2.3.2 the `Content-Length` header field was added automatically when it was computable,
for instance when the body was a string or an instance implementing `__toString()`.
Starting v2.3.2 this is no longer the case and the header field has to be defined when required.
This was decided to prevent a bug with Apache+FastCGI+DEFLATE where the `Content-Length` field
was not adjusted although the body was compressed. Also, in most cases it's not such a good idea
to define that field for generated content because it prevents the response to be send as
[compressed chunks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding).





### Redirect response

A redirect response may be created using a [RedirectResponse][] instance.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\RedirectResponse;

$response = new RedirectResponse('/to/redirect/location');
$response->status->code;        // 302
$response->status->is_redirect; // true
```





### Delivering a file

A file may be delivered using a [FileResponse][] instance. Cache control and _range_ requests
are handled automatically, you just need to provide the pathname of the file, or a `SplFileInfo`
instance, and a request.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\FileResponse;

/* @var $request \ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request */

$response = new FileResponse("/absolute/path/to/my/file", $request);
$response();
```

The `OPTION_FILENAME` option may be used to force downloading. Of course, utf-8 string are
supported:

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\FileResponse;

/* @var $request \ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request */

$response = new FileResponse("/absolute/path/to/my/file", $request, [

    FileResponse::OPTION_FILENAME => "VidÃ©o d'un Ã©tÃ© Ã  la mer.mp4"

]);

$response();
```

The following options are also available:

- `OPTION_ETAG`: Specifies the `ETag` header field of the response. If it is not defined the
[SHA-384][] of the file is used instead.

- `OPTION_EXPIRES`: Specifies the expiration date as a `DateTime` instance or a relative date
such as "+3 month", which maps to the `Expires` header field. The `max-age` directive of the
`Cache-Control` header field is computed from the current time. If it is not defined
`DEFAULT_EXPIRES` is used instead ("+1 month").

- `OPTION_MIME`: Specifies the MIME of the file, which maps to the `Content-Type` header field.
If it is not defined the MIME is guessed using `finfo::file()`.

The following properties are available:

- `modified_time`: Returns the last modified timestamp of the file.

- `is_modified`: Whether the file was modified since the last response. The value is computed
using the request header fields `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since`, and the properties
`modified_time` and `etag`.





## Headers

HTTP headers are represented by a [Headers][] instance. They are used by requests and
responses, and may be used to create the headers string of the `mail()` command as well.





### Content-Type header

The `Content-Type` header is represented by a [ContentType][] instance.

```php
<?php

/* @var $response \ICanBoogie\HTTP\Response */

$response->headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/html; charset=utf-8';

echo $response->headers['Content-Type']->type; // text/html
echo $response->headers['Content-Type']->charset; // utf-8

$response->headers['Content-Type']->type = 'application/xml';

echo $response->headers['Content-Type']; // application/xml; charset=utf-8
```





### Content-Disposition header

The `Content-Disposition` header is represented by a [ContentDisposition][] instance. Of course,
utf-8 file names are supported.

```php
<?php

/* @var $response \ICanBoogie\HTTP\Response */

$response->headers['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename="Ã©tÃ©.jpg"';

echo $response->headers['Content-Disposition']->type; // attachment
echo $response->headers['Content-Disposition']->filename; // Ã©tÃ©.jpg

echo $response->headers['Content-Disposition']; // attachment; filename="ete.jpg"; filename*=UTF-8''%C3%A9t%C3%A9.jpg
```





### Cache-Control header

The `Cache-Control` header is represented by a [CacheControl][] instance. Directives can be set at
once using a plain string, or individually using the properties of the [CacheControl][] instance.
Directives of the [rfc2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html) are supported.

```php
<?php

/* @var $response \ICanBoogie\HTTP\Response */

$response->headers['Cache-Control'] = 'public, max-age=3600, no-transform';

echo $response->headers['Cache-Control']; // public, max-age=3600, no-transform
echo $response->headers['Cache-Control']->cacheable; // public
echo $response->headers['Cache-Control']->max_age; // 3600
echo $response->headers['Cache-Control']->no_transform; // true

$response->headers['Cache-Control']->no_transform = false;
$response->headers['Cache-Control']->max_age = 7200;

echo $response->headers['Cache-Control']; // public, max-age=7200
```





### Date, Expires, If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since and Retry-After headers

All date related headers can be specified as Unix timestamp, strings or `DateTime` instances.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Response;

$response = new Response('{ "message": "Ok" }', Response::STATUS_OK, [

    'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
    'Date' => 'now',
    'Expires' => '+1 hour'

]);
```




## Request dispatcher

A [RequestDispatcher][] instance dispatches requests using a collection of
_domain dispatchers_, for which The _request dispatcher_ provides a nice framework.
The _request dispatcher_ sorts _domain dispatchers_ according to their weight, fire events,
and tries to rescue exceptions should they occur.





### Domain dispatchers

A _domain dispatcher_ handles a very specific type of request. It may be an instance implementing
the [Dispatcher][] interface, or simple callable.

The following example demonstrates how a [RequestDispatcher][] instance may be created with
several _domain dispatchers_:

- `operation`: Defined by the `icanboogie/operation` package, handles operations.
- `routes`: Defined by the `icanboogie/routing` package, handles routes defined using
the `routes` configuration.
- `pages`: Defined by the `icybee/pages` package, handles managed pages.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\RequestDispatcher;

$dispatcher = new RequestDispatcher([

    'operation' => \ICanBoogie\Operation\OperationDispatcher::class,
    'route' => \ICanBoogie\Routing\RouteDispatcher::class,
    'page' => \Icybee\Modules\Pages\PageDisptacher::class

]);
```





### Weighted domain dispatchers

The order in which the dispatcher plugins are defined is important because each one of them is
invoked in turn until one returns a response or throws an exception. Some dispatcher plugins
might need to run before others, in that case they need to be defined using a
`WeightedDispatcher` instance.

The weight is defined as an integer; the special values `top` or `bottom`; or a position relative
to a target. Consider the following example:

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\RequestDispatcher;

$dispatcher = new RequestDispatcher([

    'two' => 'dummy',
    'three' => 'dummy'

]);

$dispatcher['bottom']      = new WeightedDispatcher('dummy', 'bottom');
$dispatcher['megabottom']  = new WeightedDispatcher('dummy', 'bottom');
$dispatcher['hyperbottom'] = new WeightedDispatcher('dummy', 'bottom');
$dispatcher['one']         = new WeightedDispatcher('dummy', 'before:two');
$dispatcher['four']        = new WeightedDispatcher('dummy', 'after:three');
$dispatcher['top']         = new WeightedDispatcher('dummy', 'top');
$dispatcher['megatop']     = new WeightedDispatcher('dummy', 'top');
$dispatcher['hypertop']    = new WeightedDispatcher('dummy', 'top');

$order = '';

foreach ($dispatcher as $dispatcher_id => $dummy)
{
    $order .= ' ' . $dispatcher_id;
}

echo $order; //  hypertop megatop top one two three four bottom megabottom hyperbottom
```

Notice how the `before:` and `after:` prefixes are used to indicate how the dispatcher plugins
should be ordered relatively to the specified targets.





## Dispatcher provider

The `get_dispatcher()` helper is used to retrieve the dispatcher to use to dispatch requests
executed with `$request()`, `$request->send()`, `$request->post()`, â€¦ The helper uses
`DispatcherProvider::provide()` to obtain a dispatcher, and if no provider is defined it defines a
new instance of [ProvideDispatcher][] as provider.

The following example demonstrates how you can define your own dispatcher by defining its provider:

```php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\DispatcherProvider;
use ICanBoogie\HTTP\RequestDispatcher;
use function ICanBoogie\HTTP\get_dispatcher();

// â€¦

DispatcherProvider::define(function() use ($domain_dispatchers) {

    static $dispatcher;

    if (!$dispatcher)
    {
        $dispatcher = new RequestDispatcher($domain_dispatchers);

        new RequestDispatcher\AlterEvent($dispatcher);
    }

    return $dispatcher;

});

get_dispatcher() === DispatcherProvider::provide();   // true
```





### Altering the dispatcher

The `ICanBoogie\HTTP\RequestDispatcher::alter` event of class [RequestDispatcher\AlterEvent][] is
fired after the dispatcher has been created by an instance of [ProvideDispatcher][]. Event hooks may
attach to this event to register or alter domain dispatchers, or replace the request dispatcher
altogether.

The following code illustrate how a `hello` dispatcher, that returns
"Hello world!" when the request matches the path "/hello", can be registered.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\RequestDispatcher;
use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request;
use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Response;

$app->events->attach(function(RequestDispatcher\AlterEvent $event, RequestDispatcher $target) {

    $target['hello'] = function(Request $request) {

        if ($request->path === '/hello')
        {
            return new Response('Hello world!');
        }

    }

});
```





## Dispatching requests

When the _request dispatcher_ is asked to handle a request, it invokes each of its
_domain dispatchers_ in turn until one returns a [Response][] instance or throws an exception.
If an exception is thrown during the dispatch, the _request dispatcher_ tries to _rescue_ it
using either the _domain dispatcher's_ `rescue()` method or the event system. Around that,
events are fired to allow event hooks to alter the request, or alter or replace the response.
Finally, if the request could not be resolved into a response a [NotFound][] exception is thrown,
otherwise the response is returned.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\NotFound;
use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Request;

/* @var $dispatcher \ICanBoogie\HTTP\Dispatcher */

$request = Request::from('/path/to/resource.html');

try
{
    $response = $dispatcher($request);
    $response();
}
catch (NotFound $e)
{
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```





### Before a request is dispatched

The `ICanBoogie\HTTP\RequestDispatcher::dispatch:before` event of class [BeforeDispatchEvent][]
is fired before a request is dispatched.

Event hooks may attach to this event to provide a response to the request before the domain
dispatchers are invoked. If a response is provided the domain dispatchers are skipped.

The event is usually used to redirect requests or provide cached responses. The following code
demonstrates how a request could be redirected if its path is not normalized. For instance a
request for "/index.html" would be redirected to "/".

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\RequestDispatcher;
use ICanBoogie\HTTP\RedirectResponse;

/* @var $events \ICanBoogie\EventCollection */

$events->attach(function(RequestDispatcher\BeforeDispatchEvent $event, RequestDispatcher $dispatcher) {

    $path = $event->request->path;
    $normalized_path = $event->request->normalized_path;

    if ($path === $normalized_path)
    {
        return;
    }

    $event->response = new RedirectResponse($normalized_path);
    $event->stop();

});
```

Notice how the `stop()` method of the event is invoked to stop the event propagation and
prevent other event hooks from altering the response.





### After a request was dispatched

The `ICanBoogie\HTTP\RequestDispatcher::dispatch` event of class [DispatchEvent][] is fired after a
request was dispatched, even if no response was provided by domain dispatchers.

Event hooks may attach to this event to alter or replace the response before it is returned by the
dispatcher. The following code demonstrates how a cache could be updated after a response with the
content type "text/html" was found for a request.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\HTTP\RequestDispatcher;

/* @var $events \ICanBoogie\EventCollection */

$events->attach(function(RequestDispatcher\DispatchEvent $event, RequestDispatcher $target) use($cache) {

    $response = $event->response;

    if ($response->content_type->type !== 'text/html')
    {
        return;
    }

    $cache[sha1($event->request->uri)] = $event->response;

});
```





### Rescuing exceptions

Most likely your application is going to throw exceptions, whether they are caused by software
bugs or logic, you might want to handle them. For example, you might want to present a login form
instead of the default exception message when a [AuthenticationRequired][] exception is thrown.

Exceptions can be rescued at two levels: the domain dispatcher level, using its `rescue()`
method; or the request dispatcher level, by listening to the `Exception::rescue` event.

Event hooks may attach to the `Exception::rescue` event of class [RescueEvent][] to provide a
response for an exception. The following example demonstrates how a login form can be returned as
response when a [AuthenticationRequired][] exception is thrown.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\Event;
use ICanBoogie\HTTP\AuthenticationRequired;
use ICanBoogie\HTTP\Response;

/* @var $events \ICanBoogie\EventCollection */

$events->attach(function(ICanBoogie\Exception\RescueEvent $event, AuthenticationRequired $target) {

    ICanBoogie\log_error($target->getMessage());

    $event->response = new Response(new DocumentDecorator(new LoginForm), $target->getCode());
    $event->stop();

});
```





#### The `X-ICanBoogie-Rescued-Exception` header field

The `X-ICanBoogie-Rescued-Exception` header field is added to the response obtained while rescuing
an exception, it indicates the origin of the exception, this might help you while tracking bugs.

Note that the origin path of the exception is relative to the `DOCUMENT_ROOT`.





#### Force redirect

If they are not rescued during the `Exception::rescue` event, [ForceRedirect][] exceptions are
resolved into [RedirectResponse][] instances.





### A second chance for `HEAD` requests

When a request with a `HEAD` method fails to get a response (a [NotFound][] exception was
thrown) the dispatcher tries the same request with a `GET` method instead. If a response is
provided a new response is returned with only its status and headers but with an empty body,
otherwise the dispatcher tries to rescue the exception.

Leveraging this feature, you won't have to implement a controller for the `HEAD` method if the
controller for the `GET` method is good enough.





### Stripping the body of responses to `HEAD` requests

The dispatcher cares about responses to `HEAD` requests and will strip responses of their body
before returning them.





## Exceptions

The following exceptions are defined by the HTTP package:

* [ClientError][]: thrown when a client error occurs.
    * [NotFound][]: thrown when a resource is not found. For instance, this exception is
    thrown by the dispatcher when it fails to resolve a request into a response.
    * [AuthenticationRequired][]: thrown when the authentication of the client is required. Implements [SecurityError][].
    * [PermissionRequired][]: thrown when the client lacks a required permission. Implements [SecurityError][].
    * [MethodNotSupported][]: thrown when a HTTP method is not supported.
* [ServerError][]: throw when a server error occurs.
    * [ServiceUnavailable][]: thrown when a server is currently unavailable
    (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance).
* [ForceRedirect][]: thrown when a redirect is absolutely required.
* [StatusCodeNotValid][]: thrown when a HTTP status code is not valid.

Exceptions defined by the package implement the `ICanBoogie\HTTP\Exception` interface.
Using this interface one can easily catch HTTP related exceptions:

```php
<?php

try
{
    // â€¦
}
catch (\ICanBoogie\HTTP\Exception $e)
{
    // HTTP exception types
}
catch (\Exception $e)
{
    // Other exception types
}
```





## Helpers

The following helpers are available:

* [`dispatch()`][]: Dispatches a request using the dispatcher returned by [`get_dispatcher()`][].
* [`get_dispatcher()`][]: Returns the request dispatcher. If no dispatcher provider is defined,
the method defines a new instance of [DispatcherProvider][] as provider and use it to retrieve the
dispatcher.
* [`get_initial_request()`][]: Returns the initial request.

```php
<?php

namespace ICanBoogie\HTTP;

$request = get_initial_request();
$response = dispatch($request);
```
